After failing the entrance exams twice already, he decides to stay at his grandmother's inn in Tokyo in order to prepare for his third attempt. He is, therefore, surprised when he finds out that not only has his grandmother gone on a long vacation, but the inn has also become the Hinata House, an all-girls dormitory!\n\nUnfortunately for Keitarou, a series of misunderstandings during his first visit leave him with five untrusting tenants. But when Haruka Urashima, his aunt who works at the dorm, brings up that he is supposedly a UTokyo student, the girls' impressions of him quickly change, and they reluctantly allow him to stay. Feeling guilty about the lie, he slowly gets to know his new neighbors: the cute yet violent Naru Narusegawa, the cheeky and opportunistic Mitsune Konno, the soft-spoken Shinobu Maehara, the straight-laced Motoko Aoyama, and the mischievous Kaolla Su.\n\nThus continues the unpopular Keitarou's difficult journey to get into UTokyo, all for the chance to fulfill his childhood promise to the only girl who has ever shown any interest in him and maybe, just maybe, meet her again.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But slowly, intrigued by the dedication of his peers, he begins to learn the basics of the game.\n\nAs Hikaru enters into the world of go, guided by his intangible tutor and inspired by his rival, Akira Touya, he cannot help but be drawn into the complex game as he grows determined to prove his own abilities.

        "Ten years have passed since the end of Bakumatsu, an era of war that saw the uprising of citizens against the Tokugawa shogunate. The revolutionaries wanted to create a time of peace, and a thriving country free from oppression. The new age of Meiji has come, but peace has not yet been achieved. Swords are banned but people are still murdered in the streets. Orphans of war veterans are left with nowhere to go, while the government seems content to just line their pockets with money.\n\nOne wandering samurai, Kenshin Himura, still works to make sure the values he fought for are worth the lives spent to bring about the new era. Once known as Hitokiri Battousai, he was feared as the most ruthless killer of all the revolutionaries. Now haunted by guilt, Kenshin has sworn never to kill again in atonement for the lives he took, and he may never know peace until killing is a thing of the past.\n\nNow in the 11th year of Meiji, Kenshin stumbles upon Kaoru Kamiya, owner and head instructor of a small dojo being threatened to close its doors. The police force is powerless to stop the string of murders done in the name of her dojo by a man claiming to be the famous Battousai. Kenshin's wanderings pause for now as he joins Kaoru to clear both their names. But how long can he stay before his past catches up to him?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 28: Meteor Strike",

        "Alchemists are knowledgeable and naturally talented individuals who can manipulate and modify matter due to their art. Yet despite the wide range of possibilities, alchemy is not as all-powerful as most would believe. Human transmutation is strictly forbidden, and whoever attempts it risks severe consequences. Even so, siblings Edward and Alphonse Elric decide to ignore this great taboo and bring their mother back to life. Unfortunately, not only do they fail in resurrecting her, they also pay an extremely high price for their arrogance: Edward loses his left leg and Alphonse his entire body. Furthermore, Edward also gives up his right arm in order to seal his brother's soul into a suit of armor.\n\nYears later, the young alchemists travel across the country looking for the Philosopher's Stone, in the hopes of recovering their old bodies with its power. However, their quest for the fated stone also leads them to unravel far darker secrets than they could ever imagine.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After all, she also has feelings for his friend. Unluckily, however, their respective crushes fall for each other instead. Determined to find new love after their recent misfortunes, the pair decide to cheer each other on while maintaining their usual dynamic of constant bickering. \n\nAlthough they continually deny it, Risa and Ootani are more similar than they like to admit: they both have unusual heights, failing grades, identical tastes in food, and a tendency to act extremely childish. Together, they inspire laughter among their peers as a so-called comedic duo. Could the love that these two are looking for be closer than they think?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 12: Hoshi ni Nattemo Aishiteru\nVolume 16: Bokura no Ibasho",

It takes a special kind of person to unlock the full potential of these remnants from the past, and a unique breed of humans known as O.P.T.s (or O-Parts Tacticians) become a force to be reckoned with. Unfortunately, O-Parts can be used for good or evil purposes.\n\nJio is a young boy with a tragic past who only trusts one thing in the world: money. Little does he suspect that he is actually a very powerful O.P.T., and inside him sleeps a demon of incredible ferocity. He meets up with a girl named Ruby, and together they decide to embark on a dangerous quest to discover as many O-Parts as they can. Will Jio help Ruby realize her dream of becoming a world famous treasure hunter? More importantly, will Ruby help Jio realize his dream of--world domination?!\n\n(Source: Viz Media)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 6: Trigger",

As she does not have any friends and performs poorly at school, her mean-spirited aunt resents having to take care of her. Wholeheartedly believing that God will grant her salvation one day, she tightly holds onto the ring that her mother passed down to her.\n\nSeeking solace by spending time at her late cat's grave, Karin unexpectedly meets a boy named Kazune Kuujou, who claims he is looking for God. However, Kazune calls her weak for relying on her deceased cat for comfort. Angered by the insult, Karin subconsciously channels energy into her mother's ring. Soon enough, she begins to excel at school and classmates compliment her for the first time. Unbeknownst to her, the ring has bestowed her godly powers.\n\nThe revelation of the ring's transcendent strength catches the eyes of not only Kazune but also more sinister figures who wish to take advantage of Karin for nefarious purposes. Karin must now use her newly acquired gift to fight back against these malicious forces, unaware of the truth behind her heritage and the existence of others with similar abilities.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

His teammates, however, are reluctant to accept him into their starting lineup, as he hasn't proven himself worthy of the spot.\n\nSeishun's ultimate goal is to make it to the National Tournament by the end of the year, but they first have to make it through the Kanto Regionals to even qualify for a spot in it. With their new \"super rookie\" on the team, Seishun is ready to take on anything that comes their way. With a varied assortment of rivals and opponents that can threaten their chance at the title, the Seishun team needs to give it their all in order to rise to the top.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 5: Tennis no Oujisama (pilot)",

        "Shamans are extraordinary individuals with the ability to communicate with ghosts, spirits, and gods, which are invisible to ordinary people. The Shaman Fight\u2014a prestigious tournament pitting shamans from all over the world against each other\u2014is held every five hundred years, where the winner is crowned Shaman King. This title allows the current incumbent to call upon the Great Spirit and shape the world as they see fit.\n \nFinding himself late for class one night, Manta Oyamada, an ordinary middle school student, decides to take a shortcut through the local cemetery. Noticing him, a lone boy sitting on a gravestone invites Manta to stargaze with \"them.\" Realizing that \"them\" refers to the boy and his ghostly friends, Manta flees in terror. Later, the boy introduces himself as You Asakura, a Shaman-in-training, and demonstrates his powers by teaming up with the ghost of six-hundred-year-old samurai Amidamaru to save Manta from a group of thugs. You befriends Manta due to his ability to see spirits, and with the help of Amidamaru, they set out to accomplish You's goal of becoming the next Shaman King.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nNote: This entry is for the original printing of Shaman King.

        "Hanamichi Sakuragi, a tall, boisterous teenager with flame-red hair and physical strength beyond his years, is eager to put an end to his rejection streak of 50 and finally score a girlfriend as he begins his first year of Shohoku High. However, his reputation for delinquency and destructiveness precedes him, and most of his fellow students subsequently avoid him like the plague. As his first day of school ends, he is left with two strong thoughts: \"I hate basketball\" and \"I need a girlfriend.\"\n\nHaruko Akagi, ignorant of Hanamichi's history of misbehavior, notices his immense height and unwittingly approaches him, asking whether or not he likes basketball. Overcome by the fact that a girl is speaking to him, the red-haired giant blurts out a yes despite his true feelings. At the gym, Haruko asks if he can do a slam dunk. Though a complete novice, Hanamachi palms the ball and makes the leap...but overshoots, slamming his head into the backboard. Amazed by his near-inhuman physical abilities, Haruko quickly notifies the school's basketball captain of his feat. With this, Hanamichi is unexpectedly thrust into a world of competition for a girl he barely knows, but he soon discovers that there is perhaps more to basketball than he once thought.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "High school student Yuugi Mutou spends his days being bullied between classes and his nights playing board games and solving puzzles in his bedroom. Yuugi's penchant for gameplay comes from his grandfather, whose game shop also serves as a house for the two.\n\nOne night, Yuugi manages to solve the Millennium Puzzle, a seemingly impossible challenge that awakens his inner darkness and converts it into an alternate persona: Yami Yuugi. Transforming into the more bold and dangerous persona against his will in moments of great distress, Yuugi begins to moonlight as a vengeful vigilante, challenging bullies and evil-doers to risky games where failure results in fates worse than death.\n\nYuugi and his alter ego befriend some of the very students who once bullied him, forming unbreakable companionships with them. But the group must contend with villains far deadlier than the high school punks they originally rallied against, enemies who use games for nefarious purposes and threaten Yuugi and his friends' very lives.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "When Wischtech threatened to invade the fiefs of Szaalanden, the Emperor dispatched fourteen youths. Of these, the Seven Heroes halted the invasion to herald a time of prosperity while the four Lances of Betrayal were supposedly defeated.\n\nTwo decades later, the Lances of Betrayal have reappeared and formed a bandit militia near the frontier fief Gormbark. A man with the black sword and a scar over his left eye slays an entire troop of that militia. He is identified as a boy, K\u00f3inzell, and becomes as much an object of fear as of hope even as his own past, motivations, and purpose are a mystery to those he meets in his travel.\n\n(Source: MU)",

        "High school student Riiko Izawa has gone through a series of unrequited crushes. Each time she works up the courage to confess to a boy, he rejects her on the spot. After yet another rejection, Riiko becomes dejected and takes a walk through a nearby park. There, she discovers a lost phone and returns it to its owner.\n\nThe owner of the phone, Gaku Namikiri, is bizarre, to say the least. A traveling salesman, he pesters Riiko to accept one of his company's products as a reward. She tells him, sarcastically, that what she wants most of all is a boyfriend. Unfazed, he directs her to visit a website advertising \"lover figures,\" which she assumes to be dolls. Despite her skepticism about the company's integrity, the face of the \"Nightly Series 01\" model enchants Riiko, and she registers for a three-day free trial. She is shocked when a life-sized naked boy is actually delivered to her the next day!\n\nRiiko follows instructions to activate the very realistic robot with a kiss, and for the next three days, Night Tenjou is the best boyfriend she could ask for. However, Gaku reappears to inform her that she missed the deadline to cancel the free trial, and now she owes one hundred million yen. Alternatively, she can decide to keep Night and act as a beta tester so that the company can collect data in order to improve their future products. What choice does Riiko have? She is broke, and what's more, she has already begun to fall for the artificially intelligent Night...\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

At school she is known as \"Mayura's little sister\" and is relentlessly tormented by the older girls who know that Alice is too weak to fight back.\n\nAlice harbors a deep affection for Kyo Wakamiya, a handsome upperclassman who is on the archery team with Mayura. On the way to school one day, Alice rescues a white rabbit from the road despite the danger to herself, but gets rescued by Kyo and receives a bracelet with a single red stone. The rabbit she saves, however, is no ordinary rabbit. She reveals her true form to Alice and introduces herself as Nyozeka. Alice is told that she is destined to become a Lotis Master. The Lotis Masters use the power of words and communication to enter the Inner Heart of others. It is a powerful ability to be used carefully as Alice soon finds out.\n\nUsing the power of the Lotis Words, which reveal themselves to be in the form of runes, Alice accidentally makes her older sister disappear during a dispute over Kyo, whom Mayura had begun dating. Alice then must use the Lotis Words to try and bring her sister back from the dark. She is joined by Kyo who proves to have the Lotis powers as well, and by Frey, another Lotis master who had trained with the masters and arrives with the intention to marry Alice. Unfortunately, Mayura has been taken by the power of the Maram Words, the dark reflection of the Lotis Words. Their only hope lies in Alice and Kyo becoming the legendary Neo-Masters to discover the lost word bonding both Maram and Lotis.\n\n(Source: Mangatraders)",

        "\"In the name of the moon, I shall punish you!\"\n\nUsagi Tsukino is a cheerful 14-year-old who attends Juuban Municipal Junior High School. She prefers eating and playing video games to studying, which results in her notably poor grades. She also gets easily upset, whether by baseless insults or reasonable reprimands. It is very unlikely that she could be known as anything but a bad influence and a crybaby, but that begins to change when she meets a black cat.\n\nGiven a special brooch from the black cat named Luna, Usagi can use it to transform into a guardian of justice named Sailor Moon! She is now tasked to protect the Earth from all that is evil and to find both a missing princess and a sacred jewel known as the Mystical Silver Crystal. Whether she likes it or not, Usagi's beautiful transformation marks the start of meeting the mysterious Tuxedo Mask, fighting alongside new comrades, and learning to take responsibility in this acclaimed magical girl classic.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "At the age of four, Kiri Minase fell in love with her childhood friend Tohya Enishi and proposed to him. Their families, however, were not very supportive of this match. Both children have parents who work as models and to whom they owe their good looks. The trouble is, Kiri inherited chiseled masculine features from her father and Tohya inherited his mother's delicate beauty. For years, Kiri has been working hard toward becoming a girl worthy of Tohya, but even now, she faces constant reminders that everyone regards her as unsuitable for him due to her lack of femininity.\n\nOne day, Tohya is scouted by a fashion photographer and agrees to work as a model for the agency owned by Kiri's mother. Kiri is concerned that Tohya will be preyed upon by other men in the fashion world, and so she begs her mother to hire her as well. Her wish is granted with a twist, as she is forced to pose as a male model under the name \"Tatsuki.\" During their first photo shoot, it seems that Kiri's worries are well-founded when the photographer won't keep his hands off Tohya. With the desire to protect Tohya warring against the fear that she will appear undesirable to him the longer she pretends to be male, Kiri must come to terms with her identity and decide if outer beauty is really more important than what lies inside.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Aqua's capital, Neo-Venezia, is a near-perfect copy of the wonderful, dreamy city of Venice back on Manhome\u2014previously known as Earth. Citizens and tourists alike take their time exploring the city and admiring its rustic charm, especially by riding one of the many gondolas gliding along the waterways.\n\nHighly skilled and knowledgeable women known as Undines navigate the gondolas and act as tour guides of Neo-Venezia. Originating from Manhome, several well-renowned Undine companies have made their home in the capital, with many young girls aspiring to join their ranks.\n\nChasing her dream of becoming an Undine, Manhome native Akari Mizunashi begins her training as an apprentice at the Aria Company. Soon after arriving in town, she becomes acquainted with her mentor Alicia Florence, a pudgy cat named Aria Pokoteng, and Aika S. Granzchesta, a fellow Undine apprentice from the Himeya Company. Together with her new friends, Akari strives to become a full-fledged Undine while taking in all the magical sights and sounds that Neo-Venezia generously offers.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 2: Othello Game (Ebony &amp; Ivory)",

He attempts to reunite with his brother Koutarou, who left Germany five years ago to study robotics at a university. Unfortunately, no sooner than his brother begins an exhibition about an advanced form of machine, he's kidnapped by a mecha in the shape of a wasp and a servant of the Machine Empire. Teppei starts a chase, using a gauntlet known as the \"Messiah Fist\" to hold onto the wasp as it travels to a secretive base in the Gobi Desert which serves as the Empire's headquarters.\n\nGetting thrown into a garbage heap and facing a cyborg he somehow is familiar with, Teppei's blood awakens a relic from the past; a kirin-type B't known only as \"X\" which, five years ago, was considered the most powerful B't in existence. Both are equally stubborn, although quite different in many ways, and after a few initial squabbles, X resolves to help Teppei in his quest to save his brother.\n\n(Source: TVTropes)",

        "Subaru Sumeragi is the 13th head of his powerful onmyouji clan. Until the time comes when he must succeed his grandmother fully, Subaru is allowed to live in Tokyo with his fraternal twin, Hokuto. While Subaru is kind and shy, Hokuto has exuberance to spare, and her favorite pastime is designing bold matching outfits for the two of them to wear. Her next favorite thing to do is try to set up Subaru with their veterinarian friend Seishirou Sakurazuka who, oddly enough, is always readily available to accompany the Sumeragis throughout the city.\n\nSubaru has to resolve a variety of spiritual conflicts in Tokyo: some are cases formally brought to him by clients, and others are matters in which he decides to involve himself. A selfless teenager, he empathizes with others to the point that their pain may as well be his own. This leaves him vulnerable in a city where nearly everyone makes decisions that only benefit themselves as individuals. Hokuto hopes that if Subaru develops feelings for Seishirou, their relationship will be the one thing that he never gives up for the sake of anyone else. However, is Seishirou the best candidate for her brother's love, or is he hiding sinister secrets?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But in modern-day Japan, high school student and self-proclaimed ninja Rekka Hanabishi finds it difficult to carry on their legacy, that is, until he saves a cute girl named Yanagi Sakoshita from a group of delinquents.\n\nIn the aftermath of the event, Rekka deems Yanagi worthy of being his master, swearing to protect her. As a sign of their trust, the two reveal their most valuable secrets to each other: Yanagi can quickly heal wounds, while Rekka can create fire with just a snap of his fingers. However, their dazzling exchange does not go unnoticed as a mysterious woman called Kage Houshi appears. She somehow knows about their powers and threatens them, claiming Rekka must be returned, for he is the only one who can kill her.\n\nThe pair hold their ground, but before things can escalate any further, Kage Houshi calmly leaves. Thinking the crisis is over, Rekka and Yanagi continue their daily lives, unaware that they are about to be dragged into a centuries-long ninja conspiracy with the lives of their friends and their own on the line.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In order to obtain freedom, they must slaughter everyone else by whatever means necessary, and the last one standing is deemed the winner. As each member of the class heads down their own path, Shuuya makes it his goal to get off the island without playing the game in order to put an end to this madness once and for all.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "Chiyuki Matsuoka's given name literally means \"thousand snow,\" and it embodies her parents' wish for her to witness the first snowfall of the year perennially. This wish is exceedingly optimistic due to Chiyuki's heart condition, which increases the risk of seizures and decreases her life expectancy. The doctor who presided over her birth said she would be lucky to live 15 years.\n\nChiyuki is 17 years old when she meets the unlikely vampire Touya Kanou. He claims to hate blood, and he refuses to find a human partner with whom to share the rest of his life. Touya is 18 now, but if he took blood continually from a partner, then they both might live to be a thousand years old. \n\nChiyuki immediately volunteers to be Touya's partner, but he shoves her away in disgust, inadvertently learning of her poor health when she starts to spasm. Touya treats Chiyuki more kindly after that, but still refuses to drink her blood. She begins to suspect that there is a different reason why he keeps turning her down, but will she live long enough to discover the truth?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 1: Isshunkan no Romance (A Romance of One Moment)",

        "After being hit by a car, strange things begin to happen around Nanaki Shunsuke. He is eventually approached by another young man named Ao, who tells Nanaki that he has been sending Ao his telepathic \"voice,\" and that the accident seems to have awakened some sort of supernatural powers within Nanaki.\n\nThough less than enthusiastic about the idea, Nanaki eventually agrees to join LOCK, The Paranormal Investigations Agency, and partner up with Ao to investigate various cases dealing with the supernatural. However, Nanaki's powers are rather unstable, and Ao seems to have some reason to carry a great mistrust and annoyance for his new partner, making Nanaki's days in his new position a rather trying ordeal. But as they work alongside one another in their pathetically understaffed branch of LOCK, the two find ways they might manage to keep working together, perhaps even without getting the other killed in the process.\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 3: Divine: Bokura wa Hikari wo Mita",

        "There is a legend that says if someone eats the flesh of a mermaid, they will attain immortality; but this myth contains a darker side, in that the devourer may die or become a monster. \n\nThe youthful Yuta has been wandering Japan in search of mermaids not to become immortal, but to break his curse of eternal life. Over five hundred years ago, he ate a mermaid; now, Yuta is in search of a cure, hoping the mermaids know the secret. When he stumbles upon a hidden village, he quickly learns that it is full of mermaids that live in an underground society centered around the murder and cultivation of young human women to maintain their own youth and immortality. \n\nTheir most recent victim, Mana, is given the flesh of a mermaid to eat in order to fulfill the recipe toward being a perfect candidate to be eaten. Yuta helps her escape, and they find themselves on a journey to live their lives as normal as they can.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Selected to represent the respective candidates, the Kouga and Iga send 10 of their best fighters into a deadly battle, with the winning party deciding the rightful successor. Thus, the truce is revoked and the ruthless bloodshed begins.\n\nBut not all approve the truce's end. Gennosuke of Kouga and Oboro of Iga were to be married in hopes of ensuring lasting peace. However, unlike typical arranged marriages, they were already deeply in love. As preparations for the war ensue, Gennosuke questions his loyalties while Oboro refuses to fight.

In front of Ryouji, Tooru hides his feelings and acts as if he is just one of Ryouji's good friends, but in a moment out of the blue his world will be turned upside down as Ryouji will confess a secret desire for Tooru. Dazzled, Tooru can barely hide his excitement for Ryouji and quickly accepts his offer. As time passes, Tooru's happiness begins to fade knowing that his affair with Ryouji was just a fling based out of Ryouji's sexual curiosity.\n\nTooru, adamant about his feelings for Ryouji, confides in another one of his close friend, Kashiwazaki, about his dilemma. The two set off to devise a plan to test Ryouji's true intentions by faking a romantic relationship. Soon after, a frustrated and jealous Ryouji attempts to pry Tooru out of the arms of Kashiwazaki. Is it just as they planned? Yeah! That is of course until Tooru realizes Kashiwazaki wasn't really faking! How could he not have seen it coming?\n\nBoth Tooru and Ryouji have hidden their feelings from each other in the past, but now they have discovered that they were not the only ones. Will Tooru and Ryouji be reunited or will their true feelings for each other go unfulfilled?\n\n(Source: DMP)",

That is, except for one member of the clan-14-year-old Akira. At that awkward stage where teenagers feel out-of-place in general, Akira believes he's average in the looks department, which simply doesn't measure up. How can he be around his family when he feels like he's being judged against them all the time? Will Akira's complex about being \"different\" cause him to turn away from the people who love him most?\n\n(Source: Digital Manga Publishing)",

When he spots an injured high school student with a violin lying at his doorstep, he does not think twice about taking him in for the night. The fierce young man, introducing himself as Riya Narukawa, has no idea why he was unconscious in front of Atsushi's door but worries no further, as he claims that memory lapses are a common occurrence.\n\nThe following day, when Riya gets a sudden headache while playing the violin for Atsushi, he professes that he ran away from home because his dead brother's spirit inside him has been forcing him to play the violin. Stunned by the sudden revelation, a concerned Atsushi discovers that Riya is a prodigious violinist and the only son of a famous musician. Worried that things are not matching up, he soon learns that Riya has a multiple personality disorder, causing him to invent a deceased younger brother whom he believes to be within his soul. Carrying the weight of other people's expectations for his talent, Riya tries to come to terms with the underlying problems behind his psychological complications, all while understanding what Atsushi means to him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With mankind now an unnecessary aspect of the Earth ecosystem, Leave, along with her 'father' Fenrir (the human scientist who raised her), destroys humanity and in its stead creates the four 'Mothers' who in turn create an android race modeled on Leave known as the Selenoid.\n\nThey divide the world into four parts, each ruled by a Mother, and then further sub-divide the android population into hierarchical levels with the strong at the top and the weak at the bottom. A virtually perfect society...\n\nAnd it would have remained perfect if some of the surviving humans hadn't formed a revolutionary group together with some of the lower caste Selenoid with the explicit purpose of overthrowing Leave and delivering the Earth back into the hands of the humans.\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",

One day, a small red bean known as a magatama falls from the dark sky and into her hands. Though tempted to throw it away out of fear, she decides to keep the stone after recalling that it is a bad omen to do such an act, and so she confronts a vision of a strange woman in a magical mirror known as the Shinjyukyou later that night.\n\nThe woman warns Yuuki that her world is in danger and explains that recent occurrences of strange, dark weather came forth due to the disappearance of Amaterasu, the sun goddess. Chosen as the \"Horizon Girl,\" Yuuki must now travel to the dream world with her new magatama and find the four other magatama bearers\u2014the Amatsukami. Will Yuuki and the Amatsukami be able to save Amaterasu before the sun in both the spiritual world and their own disappears forever?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Mikan naively believes that her aloof best friend would always be by her side until Hotaru decides to depart for Tokyo to attend Alice Academy. The school is home to gifted children who possess unique abilities known as Alices. Heartbroken and feeling abandoned, Mikan runs away from home in pursuit of her friend, hoping that she too can enroll in the prestigious institution.\n\nAs Mikan gets accepted as a student at Alice Academy and reunites with her friend, she quickly learns that the academy is not all fun and games. The school itself is divided into a hierarchy system based on the strength of their Alice, behavior, and academic performance, as well as classifying each student under a specific Alice subgroup for a more personalized education. When she finds herself in the lowest rank, Mikan faces bullying from her classmates who all believe that she does not belong. Natsume Hyuuga, one of the academy's highest-ranking students, is especially vitriolic towards Mikan for seemingly no reason.\n\nThe students begin to discover that the special academy has hidden secrets\u2014many of which are a lot darker than one might think. As they unravel these mysteries, Mikan and her friends find themselves entangled in something far bigger than they could imagine.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She loves him but she's beginning to think that he might be a bit too laid back for his own good and that their relationship might not have much of a future. \"Club Hurricane\" (split into four sections and comprising by far the largest portion of the volume) is the tale of Andrew and Rose - twins who find themselves sent off to an odd, remote boarding school in the country as a result of their parents' divorce.

        "Cheerful 12-year-old Mayu Kousaka is excited for her first day of middle school until she learns that she has to sit next to Shinya Amamiya in class. Haunted by his rejection of her feelings toward him, she spends that night binging soda at her mother's cafe. Despite her efforts to get over him, she sheds a tear that drops into her cup, changing the soda into a seven-colored drink.\n\nAfter chugging the drink, Mayu suddenly meets a self-proclaimed \"drink fairy\" named Pucho, who rages at her for drinking what was supposed to be for herself. Due to Pucho's drink, Mayu now transforms whenever she drinks something\u2014which often results in disastrous effects! Both Mayu and Pucho are now endlessly distressed... until Pucho sees that Mayu may still have feelings for Shinya.\n\nTo make Pucho's seven-colored pixie pop, a human tear needs to be mixed with seven-colored drops that are gained from feelings of love. The two girls take this as an opportunity for Mayu to try again and win over Shinya, but with Shinya being difficult and Mayu's unpredictable transformations, their quest will not be easy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "Naoto Saki is a typical young boy. He gets average grades in school, and nothing about him really stands out. His favorite thing to do is sleep - which doesn't exactly endear him to his teachers when he dozes off in class. Whenever he falls asleep, Naoto dreams of the same fantasy world. Then one day, Naoto gets magically summoned into the very world he had once only seen in dreams! All at once, he's caught up in a battle between the powerful beings called Elphis, and a group of human-like beings called the Sand Dusts. For Naoto, this desert world of Orgos is no longer a dream-he can feel pain here, and possibly even die. He decides he'd rather not risk his life, and would like nothing more than to return home. But the pretty sorceress who summoned him in the first place has other plans for him.\n\n(Source: ADV)",

        "Seventeen years ago, nine Grand Masters of the Martial Arts raced to a remote mountaintop, determined to prevent a terrible prophecy. It had been foretold that on this very night, in this inhospitable place, a child would be born.\n\nA baby girl, who in time would become the catalyst for an Apocalypse, the likes of which had not been visited upon the earth in a thousand years. In order to avoid this prophecy, the child must be destroyed. But just as the noble warriors were about to fulfill their mission...they hesitated. Now, seventeen years later, a young street fighter arrives in a bustling city. He has a knack for trouble, a lust for the ladies and a wicked fighting technique.\n\nWhen he is caught peeping on the daughter of a local dojo master, a brief scuffle ends with him being taken in as a student by the wise master. All the while, a mysterious \"cursed\" young boy, who is not what he appears to be, is manipulating events from the shadows.\n\nAre his intentions evil? Is he in some way connected to the ancient prophecy? And what part will our young street fighter play in all of these unfolding events? These are the questions that will be answered in this epic tale.\n\n(Source: MU)",

        "Sealed in ancient jewels are the spirits of the heroes who tried and failed to unite China in the Three Kingdoms era. These jewels have been scattered throughout Japan, and have the power to draw out the full potential of those who inherit them. However, those owners, known as Toushi, are possessed with an insatiable appetite for battle. Hakufu Sonsaku is one such Toushi. Living in the country, Hakufu's desire to beat something to a pulp goes unfulfilled until her mother tells her to go to Tokyo, where she starts training with other Toushi and sets foot on the path to her destiny.\n\n(Source: TokyoPop)",

        "There is said to be a legendary \"Ghost of Akina\" that holds the fastest time to descend the Akina Pass. No one has ever come close to beating the record, nor has the mysterious driver of the white Toyota AE86 ever revealed themselves. Nowadays, the same AE86 can be seen every morning driving up and down the pass, making trips to a hotel residing at the top of the mountain.\n\nUnlike his classmates and coworkers, Takumi Fujiwara did not like cars. Any conversation about them would remind him of his early morning routine of delivering tofu for his father. He did not see the appeal in street racing and knew nothing about its rules or its culture. However, when tagging along to a nighttime meetup, the appearance of a rival racing team at the Akina Pass compels Takumi to hop behind the wheel of his father's AE86 and race them down the familiar mountain.\n\nThis spur-of-the-moment decision marks the beginning of Takumi's high-octane journey, shifting from his daily deliveries to becoming the greatest drift racer ever. Along the way, he slowly finds and kindles his love for street racing as he comes face-to-face with a plethora of opponents, each ready to take on the renowned Ghost of Akina.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Someone has to look out for them, and that's what Yamada Shintarou is training to do- he's going to become a monster guardian. Armed with a two-by-four and a talking rabbit, he goes out to fight the demon hunters, hoping to defeat enough of them to get his monster guardian license. It is while he is doing this that he meets Nao, a normal (if unusually pretty) high school girl, and instantly falls in love... with her neck. Now Yamada has a new mission in life: to protect Nao, and keep anyone- monster, ghost, demon hunter, or otherwise- from getting in the way of his view of her nape.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
